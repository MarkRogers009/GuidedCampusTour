                Union Market is located inside Student Union.
                The Union Market is the All You Care to Eat (AYCTE) dining hall. 
                The Union Market has grilled food, wood-fired pizzas, made-to-order stir-fry, and international cuisine.
                The dining hall also includes a comfort foods bar and a salad bar.
                The dining hall is open Monday to Friday from 11 am to 4 pm.
                The AYCTE price includes one re-entry during the same meal period. 
                The AYCTE is dine-in only with the exception of the Raider Green To-Go Container program.
