                The Rock was originally located by the main entrance on Colonel Glenn Highway, but it was moved to Springwood Lane and University Boulevard in 1998.
                The Rock was moved because of Wright State's Master Plan.
                The moving of the Rock had mixed reactions among students.
                The Rock is a canvas where students can paint anything from organization announcements to student government elections.
