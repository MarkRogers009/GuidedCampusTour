	The 25-foot 4-inch tower was created in 1988 and was located at the main entrance of the campus, but in 2002 it was moved to the Alumni Circle, which is the area behind the Student Union.
	In 2013, the area surrounding the Alumni Tower was transformed into the Alumni Grove.
	The Alumni Tower serves as a tribute to all Wright State graduates and an outdoor space that is available for use by WSU students, staff, and off-campus groups.
