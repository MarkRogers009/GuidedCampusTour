                Turning Points is located next to University Hall and Rike Hall.
                Turning Points is an art piece that was created by David Black and was installed in 1999.
                Students have nicknamed the art piece as B.A.R.T. (Big Artsy Red Thing).
                Turning Points represents the twists and turns of an undergraduate career for a student.
                The art piece also served as a landmark and guide for students on campus.
