                The community garden is located next to the Student Union and the Russ Engineering Center.
                The garden was established in 2012 by representatives from student government and has continued to thrive because of the involvement of students, university officials, and volunteers.
                The garden has been able to grow potatoes, green onions, kale, leeks, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and beans.
                The fruits and vegetables from the garden will go towards Wright State's Student Food Pantry.
